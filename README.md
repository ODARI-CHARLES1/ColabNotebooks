# Notebooks in Google Colab- My codes
A repo mainly for keeping record of my google colab notebooks. This simplifies worrk on version control
Pushinng on github simplifies work for retrieval and also collaboration with other developer.

## Machine Learning Projects

### E-Commerce Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in e-commerce platforms using synthetic data that mimics real-world patterns observed in cities like Istanbul, Berlin, New York, London, and Paris. The dataset includes approximately 300,000 transactions from 6,000 unique users, featuring multiple transactions per user (40–60) to enable behavioral analysis.

Key features of the dataset:
- Strong feature correlations for realistic modeling
- Cross-country dynamics with country and bin_country variables
- Natural fraud imbalance (~2%) similar to real financial systems
- Time-based realism with night-time fraud spikes and daily rhythms
- High explainability for easy visualization, modeling, and interpretation

The project allows building, testing, and comparing fraud-detection models without exposing real user data, making it ideal for safe experimentation and learning in machine learning for anomaly detection and classification tasks.

### Student Performance Prediction
This project analyzes the relationship between student attendance and academic performance using data analysis and machine learning. It employs linear regression and other models to predict total scores based on attendance data.

Features include:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Visualizations of attendance vs. grades using Matplotlib and Plotly
- Linear and multiple regression models
- Model evaluation with MSE, RMSE, and R² metrics
- Comparison with non-linear models like Random Forest and SVR

Sample metrics: MSE 80.93, RMSE 8.9964, R² 0.64.

### Statistics Study Notebook
A comprehensive notebook for learning fundamental statistical concepts using Python. It bridges theory and practice with hands-on exercises, visualizations, and examples.

Covers topics such as:
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.)
- Probability distributions (Normal, Binomial, Poisson)
- Correlation and regression
- Hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square, ANOVA)
- Real data applications and exploratory analysis

Uses libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, and Statsmodels. Suitable for self-study and as a reference for data science learners.

### Other Notebooks
- **Decision Trees & Random Forest**: Implementations and examples of tree-based machine learning algorithms.
- **Fare Prediction**: Likely involving regression models for predicting fares, possibly in transportation contexts.
- **Numerical Methods**: Computational approaches to solving mathematical problems.
- **Numpy Basics**: Fundamental operations and usage of the NumPy library for numerical computing.
- **Electrical Machines Experiment Analysis**: Analysis of experimental data related to electrical engineering.
